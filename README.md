## Web-browser crossword editing / solving tool

This is a tool for editing / solving crosswords in a web-browser. I have some relatives who like to work on crossword puzzles together over video call - I made this for them to make it easier to keep the puzzle synced across the call.

Live at [crossword.gloudemans.fun](https://crossword.gloudemans.fun)

Update: Now supports collaborative editing! You can create a game code and share it with your collaborators keep the state of the puzzle synced between different browsers. Did this using Firebase Realtime Database
